# 🧪 DevOps Learning Lab – Journey to Production Engineer

This repository documents my learning journey in DevOps while building real-world infrastructure and deployment environments.

Before building a full production stack, this repository was used as an experimental lab to understand core DevOps concepts such as containerization, reverse proxy, and server-based deployment.

> This repo represents my learning and experimentation phase before moving to a real production environment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository was to:

- Learn Docker and containerized environments
- Understand multi-container architecture
- Practice Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Explore Linux server-based deployment
- Prepare for real production DevOps implementation

This repository became the foundation before building my real VPS production environment.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Explored

- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx Reverse Proxy
- Basic fullstack container setup
- VPS deployment practice

---

## 📚 Learning Journey

During this phase I explored:

- Running multi-container applications
- Container networking concepts
- Reverse proxy configuration
- Basic server monitoring setup
- Troubleshooting container issues
- Manual deployment workflows

All experiments here helped me understand how production environments actually work.

## 🚀 Next Phase: Real Production Implementation

After completing experiments in this repository, I moved to building a real production-ready DevOps environment:

👉 Production Repository:  
https://github.com/byhabibi/production-stack-dev  

👉 Live Server:  
https://bybi.web.id  
https://monitoring.bybi.web.id  
https://lab.bybi.web.id  

This repository serves as the foundation and learning history behind that production environment.

## 🧠 Why This Repository Matters

Instead of only following tutorials, this repository documents hands-on experimentation and problem-solving while learning DevOps from scratch.

It shows the transition from learning → experimenting → building real production infrastructure.
